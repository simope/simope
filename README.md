# Hi there, I'm Simone üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About me 
I'm a R&D Engineer and Python developer with a passion for high-tech and cutting-edge science. <br> I'm always ready to learn some new technology, and the objective of this GitHub profile will be showing some of the projects I will work on in order to train myself and showcase my skills.

My education is in Engineering Physics (BSc, 2019) and Nanotechnologies (MSc, 2021), both obtained at Politecnico di Torino, Italy.

After that, I joined Simbeyond as R&D Engineer, in Eindhoven (NL). It was a software company developing multiphysical simulation software for organic electronics. My role was mainly working with the Python codebase, with other tasks such as research brainstorms, documentation, customer support. I worked from December 2021 to November 2023, when unfortunately the company closed. 

I'm now in London looking for a new job position, where ideally I can use the skills that I learnt and improved in these years.
